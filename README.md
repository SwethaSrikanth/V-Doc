# Virtual Doc 
@ HackCwru 2018 

FUN Hackathon project - Basically a chatbot for a virtual-Doc sparing the time and fees of *doctor visits* for not-so-severe diseases taking up 'Health' theme API of HackMeet2018!

The V-Doc Bot presents the user with a basic questionnare asking for Symptoms while the user gets to answer them one by one.
Based on the user inputs, The trained model predicts either 
 -- the disease is severe in which case it just prompts "need medical attention immediately" 
 -- If not severe, Prescribes some basic OTC medicines for the time being and 
 -- also sends sms of Nearby stores selling those medical supplies and online links for E-purchase!
